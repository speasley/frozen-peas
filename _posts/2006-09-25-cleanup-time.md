# Cleanup time

![A scrap piece of paper with 'clean up time' scrawled on it](/assets/2006-09-25-cleanup-time.jpg)

I found this on my walk home one day in the Spring of 2006.

It is half of a weathered envelope, with the words "Clean up time" written on it. This piece would eventually inspire the overhaul of <a href=\"http://www.frozen-peas.com/\">www.frozen-peas.com</a>.
