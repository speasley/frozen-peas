# Idaho magnet

I found a refrigerator but after carrying it for a few blocks realized that it was just too heavy to lug around. I took this magnet from its door instead and found it to be much more manageable.

This is a magnet with a few facts about the state of Idaho, which is a part of the United States of America.

What the magnet doesn't tell you is that Idaho's residents are called "Idahoans", the city of Boise has a S Peasley Street and that in 2007, the state had known 49 murders. It is also against Idaho law to fish on a camel's back.
