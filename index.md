## About

Hello, nerds. I am Stephen Peasley. I walk about four kilometers to get to work and back. I often find interesting things along the way. Sometimes these are dirty things that I pick up with my bare hands then carry around for the rest of the day. Sometimes they are useful things. Some things I choose to just leave behind.

Frozen Peas is dedicated to my sister, Connie. She loves to tell stories of how when I was a kid, I would bring home various things I found. Some items of note were spoons, two bamboo mats, a lawnmower, a pogo stick and more spoons.

Enjoy.

Stephen
